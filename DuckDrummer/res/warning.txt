PLEASE READ THIS
AutoDuck is a program that can automate playing the drums in Duck Game.
It does this by simulating key presses.
This means that using this program is somewhat risky.
If you use this program outside of duck game, key strokes WILL be simulated on any focused window.
So, USE THIS PROGRAM WITH CAUTION. ONLY activate it when you have Duck Game opened & focused.
To use the default keybinds, change 'up' from 'w' to '3'.
This is to separate the symbol and the hi-hat.
Activation/Deactivation shortcut: ALT + K
